# Runtime Container

This repository will define the construction of all the runtime containers for ContinuousPHP CI/CD platform

Architecture:

  1. Components:
      Component are a *Docker template* shared playbook, it can be implemented inside a Runtime platform and have its own test write with `bats`.
      The implementation of the component is made using the docker template script in python.

  2. Runtimes:
      Runtime represents a platform around the same application goal (Language) like `php`, `javascript`, `ruby`, `python`.

  3. Flavours:
      A Flavour represent a docker image distribution like debian, alpine, centos...
      A Component will integrate a dedicated script for each flavour.

## Component

 - files
 - flavours
   - component.dtc
   - tests

### Docker Template Component

Docker Template Component have `.dtc` extension and are a template file that will define `Dockerfile` instructions dedicated of the current component.
Each flavours have dedicated `.dtc` file

The template must have the following functionality:
- [x] File path replacement ( replacement of the file path by the build context )
- [ ] Conditional statement of a runtime variable ( when runtime are build, I want condition the integration of the statement if variable condition are meet, like version of runtime php-7.1)

#### Additional files

When ADD or COPY are used in components, the specified must be stored inside a "files" directory but the written path must
follow the syntax: files/component_name/path_to_files_in_files_directory

## Runtime

### Runtime Configuration

The configuration must have the following functionality:
1. variable version for `FROM` instruction
2. flavours parsing to know witch flavour of components must be included
3. list of components to includes

## Getting Started

In order to use the binary `bin/docker-template`.
You have to install theses python dependencies:

```
❯ pip3 install pyyaml
❯ ./bin/docker-template --help                                                                                                                          runtime-containers/git/feature/default_ssh_agent !+
usage: docker-template [-h] [--runtime [RUNTIME]]
                       [--version [VERSION [VERSION ...]]] [--clean]
                       [--verbose] [--replace]
                       [{build,test}]

Continuous runtime container generator

positional arguments:
  {build,test}          Command

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --runtime [RUNTIME]   Runtime
  --version [VERSION [VERSION ...]]
                        List of versions to compile
  --clean               Remove all temporary files
  --verbose             Print the entire output
  --replace             Rebuild existing images
```

### Build Runtime

```
❯ ./bin/docker-template build --runtime php --version 7.3-cli --verbose
